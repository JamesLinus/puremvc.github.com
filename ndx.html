			<!-- STABLE SINCE 2008 -->
			<section class="col-2 ss-style-triangles">
				<div class="column text">
					<h2>Stable and feature-frozen since 2008</h2>
					<p>While the "release early, release often" development philosophy can help a team learn what their product should do, if that product is a framework, adopters often tire of trying to hit a moving target. With PureMVC, we nailed down the scope early on, fixed the bugs, and let it be.</p>

			<!-- MVC IS SIMPLE -->
			<section class="color">
				<h2>MVC is simple, there's no reason to keep changing it</h2>
				<p>Many so-called Model-View-Controller frameworks today seem to include everything but the kitchen sink. We decided that basic separation of responsibilities according to the MVC meta-pattern could be expressed with a handful of actors. We gave them a built-in means to communicate with each other which reinforces the classic MVC collaboration patterns, and did so with the simplest possible language features. That's why it's been ported to so many languages from the original ActionScript. It just works, with no <i>"magic happens here"</i> bits.</p>
			</section>

			<!-- MVC ACTORS-->
			<section class="col-3 ss-style-doublediagonal">
				<div class="column">
					<span class="icon icon-data"></span>
					<p class="white">The Model is both a class and a region of the application. <br/><br/>It manages Proxies, which deal with different parts of the application's data. <br/><br/>Proxies can notify the View and Controller.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column">
					<span class="icon icon-display"></span>
					<p class="white">The View is both a class and a region of the application. <br/><br/>It manages Mediators, which handle events from, and pass data to View Components.<br/><br/>Mediators can update the Model and notify the Controller.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column">
					<span class="icon icon-game-controller"></span>
					<p class="white">The Controller is both a class and a region of the application. <br/><br/>It manages Commands, which house the application's business logic. <br/><br/>Commands can notify the View and update the Model.</p>
				</div>

			<!-- FACADE -->
			<section class="col-2 ss-style-halfcircle">
				<div class="column">
					<span class="icon icon-tree"></span>
				</div>
				<div class="column text">
					<h2>The Facade connects the Model, View, and Controller</h2>
					<p>Available to all Proxies, Commands, and Mediators, it exposes the Model, View, and Controller methods all in one place, obviating the need to work with those classes directly.<br/><br/>It also provides the means for sending notifications according to a simple publish/subscribe scheme.</p>

					<h2>Multicore enables modular programming</h2>
					<p>While the basic MVC paradigm implemented in the PureMVC Standard Framework is adequate for many applications, the Multicore version (available in most supported languages) allows self-contained subsystems, each with its own Facade, Model, View, Controller, and attendant actors. This is really useful when many teams are contributing to the application. <b>Scalability: Infinite.</b></p>

				<h2>Implementation Idioms and Best Practices</h2>
				<p>An in-depth document written by the architect, describing the best practices for use of PureMVC in your applications.
